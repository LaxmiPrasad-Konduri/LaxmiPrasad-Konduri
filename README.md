# 👋 Hi, I'm LaxmiPrasad Konduri

I'm a high school student from Aurora, Illinois passionate about **Computer Science, Math, and Business** — and how they all connect to solve real-world problems.

Ever since I learned algebra, I’ve loved the challenge of finding “X.” Whether it’s solving equations, debugging code, or analyzing data, I enjoy breaking big problems into smaller pieces and finding the logic underneath.
